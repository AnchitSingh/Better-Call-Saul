Better Call Saul - Multi-Agent Corporate Formation Advisory System

This module defines a coordinated multi-agent system for business entity selection
and formation strategy. The system combines tax, legal, and strategic expertise to
provide comprehensive guidance on LLC vs S-Corp vs C-Corp decisions.

Architecture:
    - Three specialist agents (Tax CPA, Corporate Attorney, Business Strategist)
    - One coordinator agent that orchestrates parallel consultation and synthesis
    - All agents powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash for fast, cost-effective inference

Usage:
    The root_agent serves as the entry point for user interactions and delegates
    to specialist sub-agents as needed.
